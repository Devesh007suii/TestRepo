## Overview

- This website allows users to listen to beats that I upload and add their reviews.
- In the future, I plan to add more questions for users in the review form.
- The review form currently includes a main question about whether users want to collaborate with me. If they choose to collaborate, additional questions about the type of collaboration they are interested in will appear.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**
- **Express**
- **React**
